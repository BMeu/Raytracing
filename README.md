# 2D Raytracing

This is a simple 2D raytracing experiment written in [p5.js](https://p5js.org). You can
[try it live](https://bmeu.github.io/Raytracing/).

## Known Issues

* The raytracing will not correctly recognize boundaries that intersect each other. This could be fixed by splitting
  affected boundaries at their point of intersection.
